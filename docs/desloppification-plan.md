# Desloppification

Alto is at `0.0.1`. Preserve capabilities; internal APIs, formats, sequencing
and error details may change without migrations. Prefer Elixir, OTP and existing
libraries. Add no dependencies for this cleanup. Moving code or compressing
formatting does not count as simplification.

## Measurement

The fixed baseline is **40,655** physical production `.ex` lines under `lib/`
and `packages/alto_tui/lib/`. The 30% target is **at most 28,458**.

Current: **33,405 lines**, a **17.8% reduction**, with **4,947 lines remaining**.
Added functionality does not reset the baseline. Source-documentation reductions
are included in the physical count; tests, Markdown, examples, dependencies and
generated output are excluded. Report implementation and documentation savings
separately rather than treating removed prose as simplified behavior.

```sh
git ls-files -z 'lib/*.ex' 'packages/alto_tui/lib/*.ex' |
  xargs -0 -I{} sh -c 'test ! -f "$1" || wc -l "$1"' sh {} |
  awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'
```

## Current architecture

The substantive consolidations are grouped here; Git history holds individual
changes and historical test counts. Contracts belong in the component guides.

- Execution owns authority, budgets and input once, projecting tool contexts at
  invocation. Tool and agent operations share dispatch fencing, bounded outcomes
  and completion. Checkpoint variants share capture and restore; workspace
  actions update one retained resource under revision fencing.
- `Agents` owns synchronous and asynchronous child startup, subscriptions,
  completion and shutdown. Synchronous batches use scoped schedulers and raw
  source-ordered outcomes; parent checks authorize queue refills. Shutdown drains
  subscriptions before forced termination. See [runners](runners.md) and
  [subagents](subagents.md).
- MCP and Codex share the JSON-RPC process host, framing, request admission and
  startup handling. Private Codex clients monitor their tool owner and close the
  entire process group on tool exit, including during initialization. They no
  longer need a guardian or a `turn/interrupt` handshake before shutdown.
- Registry, queue and ledger callers use one request contract each. Consumer
  settlement happens at one boundary after durable work. Snapshot persistence
  shares bounded reads, locked updates and atomic replacement. Queue records
  have one representation across storage, replay and reads.
- File writes and edits share preparation and commit. File/diff previews share
  bounded iodata traversal. Command output retains one bounded first/last buffer.
  Context policies and tokenizer adapters use existing tuple/function contracts.
- TUI state uses canonical catalog, task and run data. Rendering shares per-frame
  projections; backend event and approval flows reuse existing handlers. User
  and agent messages share input channels, receipts and validation.

The latest lifecycle changes remove **45 net production lines**: 8 from deleting
`SubagentBatch` after including its shared-scheduler adapter, and 37 from removing
the private Codex guardian. This remains below the intended scale of reductions.
No dependency or migration was introduced. Earlier cleanup introduced one SSE
library to replace two parsers; subsequent passes have added no dependencies.

## Remaining work

The target is not met. Prioritize deleting duplicate workflows through functional
composition and canonical state. The “Analyze code duplication” findings have
been checked against callers; reject extractions that add adapters without
removing implementation. Recent CLI/menu/selection reviews found no substantial
remaining duplication; merely wrapping their distinct flows is not progress.

Preserve append-before-dispatch durability, single-use grants, bounded retention,
frozen approval values, and the distinction between rejection and uncertain
mutation. Exact session payloads and portable wire projections serve different
purposes. Terminal selection retains raw text capture because exporting cell
maps slowed mouse-down handling. Remove constructor-echo tests, while retaining
failure, concurrency, recovery, authority and user-interaction coverage.

## Harness fixes and verification

Tuple errors now retain the surrounding JSON result shape, including successful
siblings' output, run IDs and usage. Spawn/start schemas use the resolved child
limit; tests cover limits 1, 4 and 12, plus acceptance/rejection of five children.
Codex follow-ups retain model/effort selection. Restored mailboxes reject duplicate
IDs, malformed messages and missing queued receipts.

The final core suite passes **1,074 tests**. The TUI suite passes **142 tests**
on this pass before the final subscription-drain correction; that correction is
covered by the final core run and 42 focused scheduler/continuation tests.
New regressions cover owner death during unfinished startup, custom-runner
cancellation without calling `await` again, and Codex cancellation during its
initialization handshake. Cleanup tests check actual process exit. Formatting
and diff checks pass. Run test VMs sequentially with `--max-cases 8`; concurrent
VMs caused timing failures.

Earlier differential checks matched 12,962 valid UTF-8 diff previews, 42,480 prose
projections, 8,721 protocol decodes and 100,000 subscriber transitions. Converted
registry and ledger calls were compared against their prior arguments before
running the suites. Terminal selection remains approximately 1 ms at 200×60.

Real-key PTY tests cover Ctrl+G/Q and Ctrl+C. The documented
`mix alto.tui --config ../../alto.agentic.exs` emits terminal mode resets on
normal exit. GNU Screen/GNOME Terminal mouse leakage was not reproduced;
no speculative workaround was retained.
